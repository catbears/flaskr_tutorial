# Flaskr Tutorial

Learning about Flask with the official tutorial:
<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/tutorial/">Flaskr-Tutorial</a>.

To run the app, use the following in your Powershell console:<br><br>
<code>
PS:> $env:FLASK_APP = "flaskr"<br>
PS:> $env:FLASK_ENV = "development"<br>
PS:> flask run
</code>

## Tests
Written and ready to go.

To run the test, flaskr needs to be installed - which I skipped on purpose.
